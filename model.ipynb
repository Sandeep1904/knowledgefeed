      "Throughout this paper, we will assume that G is a simple, connected graph of order n , that is, with n vertices. Let G be a connected graph with vertex set { 1 , . . . , n } . The distance between vertices i and j of G , denoted by dist( i, j ), is defined to be the length (i.e., the number of edges) of the shortest path from i to j [2]. The distance matrix of G , denoted by D G ( ) is the n × n matrix with its ( i, j )-entry equal to dist( i, j ), i, j = 1 2 , , . . . , n . Note that dist( i, i ) = 0, i = 1 2 , , . . . , n . The distance eigenvalue of largest magnitude is called the distance spectral radius, and is denoted by Λ . 1 Balaban et al. [1] proposed the use of Λ 1 as a structure-descriptor, and it was successfully used to make inferences about the extent of branching and boiling points of alkanes[1, 9].\n",

      "\n",
      "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t -1 and the input for position t . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
      "\n",
      "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Model Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations ( x , ..., x 1 n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = ( z , ..., z 1 n ) . Given z , the decoder then generates an output sequence ( y , ..., y 1 m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n",

      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x +Sublayer( x )) , where Sublayer( x ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512 .\n",

      "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i .\n",

Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n",

      "While for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3].

To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .\n",

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].\n",
      "- · The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n",
      "- · Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -∞ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n",

      "## 4 Why Self-Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations ( x , ..., x 1 n ) to another sequence of equal length ( z , ..., z 1 n ) , with x , z i i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O n ( ) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
      "\n",
      "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d , which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O n/r ( ) . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k &lt; n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O n/k ( ) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O log ( k ( n )) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O k ( · n · d + n · d 2 ) . Even with k = n , however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n",
      "\n",
      "As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",

      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the introduction of the self-attention mechanism, Transformers have been the top choice when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Self-attention-based models are highly parallelizable and require substantially fewer parameters, making them much more computationally efficient, less prone to overfitting, and easier to fine-tune for domain-specific tasks [1]. Furthermore, the key advantage of transformers over past models (like RNN, LSTM, GRU and other neural-based architectures that dominated the NLP domain prior to the introduction of Transformers) is their ability to process input sequences of any length without losing context, through the use of the self-attention mechanism that focuses on different parts of the input sequence, and how those parts interact with other parts of the sequence, at different times [2]. Because of these qualities, Transformers has made it possible to train language models of unprecedented size, with more than 100B parameters, paving the way for the current state-of-the-art advanced models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the field of computer vision, convolutional neural networks or CNNs, remain dominant in most, if not all, computer vision tasks. While there has been an increasing collection of research work that attempts to implement self-attention-based architectures to perform computer vision tasks, very few has reliably outperformed CNNs with promising scalability [3]. The main challenge with integrating the transformer architecture with image-related tasks is that, by design, the self-attention mechanism, which is the core component of transformers, has a quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length, i.e. O(n2), as shown in Table I and as discussed further in Part 2.1. This is usually not a problem for NLP tasks that use a relatively small number of tokens per input sequence (e.g., a 1,000-word paragraph will only have 1,000 input tokens, or a few more if sub-word units are used as tokens instead of full words). However, in computer vision, the input sequence (the image) can have a token size with orders of magnitude greater than that of NLP input sequences. For example, a relatively small 300 x 300 x 3 image can easily have up to 270,000 tokens and require a self-attention map with up to 72.9 billion parameters (270,0002) when self-attention is applied naively.\n",

      "Table I. Time complexity for different layer types [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason, most of the research work that attempt to use self-attention-based architectures to perform computer vision tasks did so either by applying self-attention locally, using transformer blocks in conjunction with CNN layers, or by only replacing specific components of the CNN architecture while maintaining the overall structure of the network; never by only using a pure transformer [3]. The goal of Dr. Dosovitskiy, et. al. in their work, “An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale”, is to show that it is indeed possible to implement image classification by applying self-attention globally through the use of the basic Transformer encoder architure, while at the same time requiring significantly less computational resources to train, and outperforming state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks like ResNet.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. The Transformer\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers, introduced in the paper titled “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. in 2017,  are a class of neural network architectures that have revolutionized various natural language processing and machine learning tasks. A high level view of its architecture is shown in Fig. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 1. The Transformer model architecture showing the encoder (left block)\n",
      "and decoder components (right block) [2]\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its introduction, transformers have served as the foundation for many state-of-the-art models in NLP; including BERT, GPT, and more. Fundamentally, they are designed to process sequential data, such as text data, without the need for recurrent or convolutional layers [2]. They achieve this by relying heavily on a mechanism called self-attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The self-attention mechanism is a key innovation introduced in the paper that allows the model to capture relationships between different elements in a given sequence by weighing the importance of each element in the sequence with respect to other elements [2]. Say for instance, you want to translate the following sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the word “it” in this particular sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or the animal? For us humans, this may be a trivial question to answer. But for an algorithm, this can be considered a complex task to perform. However, through the self-attention mechanism, the transformer model is able to estimate the relative weight of each word with respect to all the other words in the sentence, allowing the model to associate the word “it” with “animal” in the context of our given sentence [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 2.  Sample output of the 5th encoder in a 5-encoder stack self-attention block given the word “it” as an input. We can see that the attention mechanism is associating our input word with the phrase “The Animal” [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1. The Self-Attention Mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "A transformer transforms a given input sequence by passing each element through an encoder (or a stack of encoders) and a decoder (or a stack of decoders) block, in parallel [2]. Each encoder block contains a self-attention block and a feed forward neural network. Here, we only focus on the transformer encoder block as this was the component used by Dosovitskiy et al. in their Vision Transformer image classification model.\n",
      "\n",
      "As is the case with general NLP applications, the first step in the encoding process is to turn each input word into a vector using an embedding layer which converts our text data into a vector that represents our word in the vector space while retaining its contextual information. We then compile these individual word embedding vectors into a matrix X, where each row i represents the embedding of each element i in the input sequence. Then, we create three sets of vectors for each element in the input sequence; namely, Key (K), Query (Q), and Value (V). These sets are derived by multiplying matrix X with the corresponding trainable weight matrices WQ, WK, and WV [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, we perform a matrix multiplication between K and Q, divide the result by the square-root of the dimensionality of K: …and then apply a softmax function to normalize the output and generate weight values between 0 and 1 [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "We will call this intermediary output the attention factor. This factor, shown in Eq. 4, represents the weight that each element in the sequence contributes to the calculation of the attention value at the current position (word being processed). The idea behind the softmax operation is to amplify the words that the model thinks are relevant to the current position, and attenuate the ones that are irrelevant. For example, in Fig. 3, the input sentence “He later went to report Malaysia for one year” is passed into a BERT encoder unit to generate a heatmap that illustrates the contextual relationship of each word with each other. We can see that words that are deemed contextually associated produce higher weight values in their respective cells, visualized in a dark pink color, while words that are contextually unrelated have low weight values, represented in pale pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 3. Attention matrix visualization – weights in a BERT Encoding Unit [5]\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we multiply the attention factor matrix to the value matrix V to compute the aggregated self-attention value matrix Z of this layer [2], where each row i in Z represents the attention vector for word i in our input sequence.  This aggregated value essentially bakes the “context” provided by other words in the sentence into the current word being processed. The attention equation shown in Eq. 5 is sometimes also referred to as the Scaled Dot-Product Attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 The Multi-Headed Self-Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "In the paper by Vaswani et. al., the self-attention block is further augmented with a mechanism known as the “multi-headed” self-attention, shown in Fig 4. The idea behind this is instead of relying on a single attention mechanism, the model employs multiple parallel attention “heads” (in the paper, Vaswani et. al. used 8 parallel attention layers), wherein each of these attention heads learns different relationships and provides unique perspectives on the input sequence [2]. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two important ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it expands the ability of the model to focus on different positions within the sequence. Depending on multiple variations involved in the initialization and training process, the calculated attention value for a given word (Eq. 5) can be dominated by other certain unrelated words or phrases or even by the word itself [4]. By computing multiple attention heads, the transformer model has multiple opportunities to capture the correct contextual relationships, thus becoming more robust to variations and ambiguities in the input.Second, since each of our Q, K, V matrices are randomly initialized independently across all the attention heads, the training process then yields several Z matrices (Eq. 5), which gives the transformer multiple representation subspaces [4]. For example, one head might focus on syntactic relationships while another might attend to semantic meanings. Through this, the model is able to capture more diverse relationships within the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 4. Illustrating the Multi-Headed Self-Attention Mechanism. Each individual attention head yields a scaled dot-product attention value, which are concatenated and multiplied to a learned matrix WO to generate the aggregated multi-headed self-attention value matrix [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. The Vision Transformer\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental innovation behind the Vision Transformer (ViT) revolves around the idea that images can be processed as sequences of tokens rather than grids of pixels. In traditional CNNs, input images are analyzed as overlapping tiles via a sliding convolutional filter, which are then processed hierarchically through a series of convolutional and pooling layers. In contrast, ViT treats the image as a collection of non-overlapping patches, which are treated as the input sequence to a standard Transformer encoder unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 5. The Vision Transformer architecture (left), and the Transfomer encoder unit\n",
      "derived from the Fig. 1 (right)[3].\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "By defining the input tokens to the transformer as non-overlapping image patches rather than individual pixels, we are therefore able to reduce the dimension of the attention map from ⟮𝐻 𝓍 𝑊⟯2 to ⟮𝑛𝑝ℎ 𝓍 𝑛𝑝𝑤 ⟯2 given 𝑛𝑝ℎ ≪𝐻 and 𝑛𝑝𝑤≪ 𝑊; where 𝐻 and 𝑊 are the height and width of the image, and  𝑛𝑝ℎ and  𝑛𝑝𝑙 are the number of patches in the corresponding axes. By doing so, the model is able to handle images of varying sizes without requiring extensive architectural changes [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "These image patches are then linearly embedded into lower-dimensional vectors, similar to the word embedding step that produces matrix X in Part 2.1. Since transformers do not contain recurrence nor convolutions, they lack the capacity to encode positional information of the input tokens and are therefore permutation invariant [2]. Hence, as it is done in NLP applications, a positional embedding is appended to each linearly encoded vector prior to input into the transformer model, in order to encode the spatial information of the patches, ensuring that the model understands the position of each token relative to other tokens within the image. Additionally, an extra learnable classifier cls embedding is added to the input. All of these (the linear embeddings of each 16 x 16 patch, the extra learnable classifier embedding, and their corresponding positional embedding vectors) are passed through a standard Transformer encoder unit as discussed in Part 2. The output corresponding to the added learnable cls embedding is then used to perform classification via a standard MLP classifer head [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. The Result\n",
      "\n",
      "In the paper, the two largest models, ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/16, both pre-trained on the JFT-300M dataset, are compared to state-of-the-art CNNs—as shown in Table II, including Big Transfer (BiT), which employs supervised transfer learning with large ResNets, and Noisy Student, a large EfficientNet trained using semi-supervised learning on ImageNet and JFT-300M without labels [3]. At the time of this study’s publication, Noisy Student held the state-of-the-art position on ImageNet, while BiT-L on the other datasets utilized in the paper [3]. All models were trained in TPUv3 hardware, and the number of TPUv3-core-days that it took to train each model were recorded.\n",

      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see from the table that Vision Transformer models pre-trained on the JFT-300M dataset outperforms ResNet-based baseline models on all datasets; while, at the same time, requiring significantly less computational resources (TPUv3-core-days) to pre-train. A secondary ViT-L/16 model was also trained on a much smaller public ImageNet-21k dataset, and is shown to also perform relatively well while requiring up to 97% less computational resources compared to state-of-the-art counter parts [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the performance between the BiT and ViT models (measured using the ImageNet Top1 Accuracy metric) across different pre-training datasets of varying sizes. We see that the ViT-Large models underperform compared to the base models on the small datasets like ImageNet, and roughly equivalent performance on ImageNet-21k. However, when pre-trained on larger datasets like JFT-300M, the ViT clearly outperforms the base model [3].\n",

      "\n",
      "Further exploring how the size of the dataset relates to model performance, the authors trained the models on various random subsets of the JFT dataset—9M, 30M, 90M, and the full JFT-300M. Additional regularization was not added on smaller subsets in order to assess the intrinsic model properties (and not the effect of regularization) [3]. Fig. 7 shows that ViT models overfit more than ResNets on smaller datasets. Data shows that ResNets perform better with smaller pre-training datasets but plateau sooner than ViT; which then outperforms the former with larger pre-training. The authors conclude that on smaller datasets, convolutional inductive biases play a key role in CNN model performance, which ViT models lack. However, with large enough data, learning relevant patterns directly outweighs inductive biases, wherein ViT excels [3].\n",

      "Finally, the authors analyzed the models’ transfer performance from JFT-300M vs total pre-training compute resources allocated, across different architectures, as shown in Fig. 8. Here, we see that Vision Transformers outperform ResNets with the same computational budget across the board. ViT uses approximately 2-4 times less compute to attain similar performance as ResNet [3]. Implementing a hybrid model does improve performance on smaller model sizes, but the discrepancy vanishes for larger models, which the authors find surprising as the initial hypothesis is that the convolutional local feature processing should be able to assist ViT regardless of compute size [3].\n",

      "### 4.1 What does the ViT model learn?\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to understand how ViT processes image data, it is important to analyze its internal representations. In Part 3, we saw that the input patches generated from the image are fed into a linear embedding layer that projects the 16×16 patch into a lower dimensional vector space, and its resulting embedded representations are then appended with positional embeddings. Fig. 9 shows that the model indeed learns to encode the relative position of each patch in the image. The authors used cosine similarity between the learned positional embeddings across patches [3]. High cosine similarity values emerge on similar relative area within the position embedding matrix corresponding to the patch; i.e., the top right patch (row 1, col 7) has a corresponding high cosine similarity value (yellow pixels) on the top-right area of the position embedding matrix [3].\n",

      "Fig. 9. Learned positional embedding for the input image patches [3].\n",

      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Fig. 10 (left) shows the top principal components of learned embedding filters that are applied to the raw image patches prior to the addition of the positional embeddings. What’s interesting for me is how similar this is to the learned hidden layer representations that you get from Convolutional neural networks, an example of which is shown in the same figure (right) using the AlexNet architecture.\n",

      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "By design, the self-attention mechanism should allow ViT to integrate information across the entire image, even at the lowest layer, effectively giving ViTs a global receptive field at the start. We can somehow see this effect in Fig. 10 where the learned embedding filters captured lower level features like lines and grids, as well as higher level patterns combining lines and color blobs. This in contrast with CNNs whose receptive field size at the lowest layer is very small (because local application of the convolution operation only attends to the area defined by the filter size), and only widens towards the deeper convolutions as further applications of convolutions extract context from the combined information extracted from lower layers. The authors further tested this by measuring the attention distance which is computed from the “average distance in the image space across which information is integrated based on the attention weights [3].” The results are shown in Fig. 11.\n",

      "From the figure, we can see that even at very low layers of the network, some heads attend to most of the image already (as indicated by data points with high mean attention distance value at lower values of network depth); thus proving the ability of the ViT model to integrate image information globally, even at the lowest layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors also calculated the attention maps from the output token to the input space using Attention Rollout by averaging the attention weights of the ViT-L/16 across all heads and then recursively multiplying the weight matrices of all layers. This results in a nice visualization of what the output layer attends to prior to classification, shown in Fig. 12 [3].\n",

      "## 5. So, is ViT the future of Computer Vision?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vision Transformer (ViT) introduced by Dosovitskiy et. al. in the research study showcased in this paper is a groundbreaking architecture for computer vision tasks. Unlike previous methods that introduce image-specific biases, ViT treats an image as a sequence of patches and process it using a standard Transformer encoder, such as how Transformers are used in NLP. This straightforward yet scalable strategy, combined with pre-training on extensive datasets, has yielded impressive results as discussed in Part 4. The Vision Transformer (ViT) either matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art on numerous image classification datasets (Fig. 6, 7, and 8), all while maintaining cost-effectiveness in pre-training [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, like in any technology, it has its limitations. First, in order to perform well, ViTs require a very large amount of training data that not everyone has access to in the required scale, especially when compared to traditional CNNs. The authors of the paper used the JFT-300M dataset, which is a limited-access dataset managed by Google [7]. The dominant approach to get around this is to use the model pre-trained on the large dataset, and then fine-tune it to smaller (downstream) tasks. However, second, there are still very few pre-trained ViT models available as compared to the available pre-trained CNN models, which limits the availability of transfer learning benefits for these smaller, much more specific computer vision tasks. Third, by design, ViTs process images as sequences of tokens (discussed in Part 3), which means they do not naturally capture spatial information [3]. While adding positional embeddings do help remedy this lack of spatial context, ViTs may not perform as well as CNNs in image localization tasks, given CNNs convolutional layers that are excellent at capturing these spatial relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, the authors mention the need to further study scaling ViTs for other computer vision tasks such as image detection and segmentation, as well as other training methods like self-supervised pre-training [3]. Future research may focus on making ViTs more efficient and scalable, such as developing smaller and more lightweight ViT architectures that can still deliver the same competitive performance. Furthermore, providing better accessibility by creating and sharing a wider range of pre-trained ViT models for various tasks and domains can further facilitate the development of this technology in the future.\n",
