      "content": "The token limit depends on the model behind the chat interface. For instance:\n\n• GPT‑3.5 Turbo typically allows a conversation (combined input and output) of about 4,096 tokens.  \n• GPT‑4 can offer more—commonly around 8,192 tokens, with some versions going up to 32,768 tokens.\n\nThese limits include both your messages and the responses. If you exceed the limit, you may need to shorten or trim the conversation history.  \n\nKeep in mind that the exact limits for DuckDuckGo’s chat service (ddgs chat) might also depend on any custom configurations or restrictions they’ve put in place, so it could be a good idea to check with their specific documentation or support if you're looking for precise details."

Token limits and other specifications for such a model would be determined by how it was configured.\n\nFor example, in many chat systems:\n  \n• Smaller models might have lower token capacities compared to larger ones.  \n• The typical token limit could be anywhere from a couple of thousand tokens down if the model is designed to be lightweight.\n\nIf you're using DuckDuckGo's chat interface and it's referencing a \"03-mini\" model, the best approach is to consult DuckDuckGo's documentation or support resources for official details. Unfortunately, without more context or official documentation on the \"03-mini\" model, I can't provide precise figures for its token limits."
